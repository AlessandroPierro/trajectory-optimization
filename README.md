# Trajectory Optimization
This repository contains the code for my bachelor thesis on "Direct collocation methods for trajectory optimization problems".

## Running the code
The code has been developed using Python 3.8. The required packages can be installed using the Anaconda package manager with:
```
conda install -y scipy numpy matplotlib bokeh
```
Please note that, in order to export the plots to PNG, you also need to run:
```
conda install -y -c conda-forge selenium firefox geckodriver  
```
